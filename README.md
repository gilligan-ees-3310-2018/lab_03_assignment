There are two files with exercises for this lab.

1. Start with `Lab_02_data_exercises.Rmd`, which has exercises
for downloading climate data from the internet and using various tools from the
`tidyverse` package to manipulate the data, analyze it, and plot it.

2. Next, do the exercises in `Lab_02_modtran_exercises`. This has 
instructions for running  the MODTRAN model from R, downloading output data,
and reading that data into R and plotting it.

    * For this part, you will do exercises from Chapter 4 of 
      _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.
      
        * Graduate students will do exercises 4.1--4.3
        * Undergraduate students will do exercises 4.1 and 4.3 (not 4.2).

## Instructions:

* Clone a local copy of the file repository from github.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the templates
  `Lab_02_data_exercises.Rmd` and `Lab_02_modtran_exercises.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

    The last changes that you push before the due date (9:00 AM on Friday 
    Sept. 8) will be graded.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those commits
to github.
